Building a Reference-Free Translation QA System

This project is an LLM as a judge evaluation system for translation from English to Russian. Every task needs evaluation. Our task is a translation system. As you know, we can evaluate everything with annotators, but it is time-consuming and expensive. So, it would be valuable to know how to evaluate a system via Llms.
